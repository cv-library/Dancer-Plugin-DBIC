=head1 DESCRIPTION

This plugin makes it very easy to create L<Dancer> applications that interface
with databases.
It automatically exports the keyword C<schema> which returns a
L<DBIx::Class::Schema> object.
You just need to configure your database connection information.
For performance, schema objects are cached in memory
and are lazy loaded the first time they are accessed.

This plugin is now just a thin wrapper around L<DBICx::Sugar>.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

Configuration can be done in your L<Dancer> config file.

=head2 simple example

Here is a simple example. It defines one database named C<default>:

    plugins:
      DBIC:
        default:
          dsn: dbi:SQLite:dbname=myapp.db
          schema_class: MyApp::Schema

=head2 multiple schemas

In this example, there are 2 databases configured named C<default> and C<foo>:

    plugins:
      DBIC:
        default:
          dsn: dbi:SQLite:dbname=myapp.db
          schema_class: MyApp::Schema
        foo:
          dsn: dbi:Pg:dbname=foo
          schema_class: Foo::Schema
          user: bob
          password: secret
          options:
            RaiseError: 1
            PrintError: 1

Each database configured must at least have a dsn option.
The dsn option should be the L<DBI> driver connection string.
All other options are optional.

If you only have one schema configured, or one of them is named
C<default>, you can call C<schema> without an argument to get the only
or C<default> schema, respectively.

If a schema_class option is not provided, then L<DBIx::Class::Schema::Loader>
will be used to dynamically load the schema by introspecting the database
corresponding to the dsn value.
You need L<DBIx::Class::Schema::Loader> installed for this to work.

WARNING: Dynamic loading is not recommended for production environments.
It is almost always better to provide a schema_class option.

The schema_class option should be the name of your L<DBIx::Class::Schema> class.
See L</"SCHEMA GENERATION">
Optionally, a database configuration may have user, password, and options
parameters as described in the documentation for C<connect()> in L<DBI>.

=head2 connect_info

Alternatively, you may also declare your connection information inside an
array named C<connect_info>:

    plugins:
      DBIC:
        default:
          schema_class: MyApp::Schema
          connect_info:
            - dbi:Pg:dbname=foo
            - bob
            - secret
            -
              RaiseError: 1
              PrintError: 1

=head2 replicated

You can also add database read slaves to your configuration with the
C<replicated> config option.
This will automatically make your read queries go to a slave and your write
queries go to the master.
Keep in mind that this will require additional dependencies:
L<DBIx::Class::Optional::Dependencies#Storage::Replicated>
See L<DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::Replicated> for more details.
Here is an example configuration that adds two read slaves:

    plugins:
      DBIC:
        default:
          schema_class: MyApp::Schema
          dsn: dbi:Pg:dbname=master
          replicated:
            balancer_type: ::Random     # optional
            balancer_args:              # optional
                auto_validate_every: 5  # optional
                master_read_weight:1    # optional
            # pool_type and pool_args are also allowed and are also optional
            replicants:
              -
                - dbi:Pg:dbname=slave1
                - user1
                - password1
                -
                  quote_names: 1
                  pg_enable_utf8: 1
              -
                - dbi:Pg:dbname=slave2
                - user2
                - password2
                -
                  quote_names: 1
                  pg_enable_utf8: 1

=head2 alias

Schema aliases allow you to reference the same underlying database by multiple
names.
For example:

    plugins:
      DBIC:
        default:
          dsn: dbi:Pg:dbname=master
          schema_class: MyApp::Schema
        slave1:
          alias: default

Now you can access the default schema with C<schema()>, C<schema('default')>,
or C<schema('slave1')>.
This can come in handy if, for example, you have master/slave replication in
your production environment but only a single database in your development
environment.
You can continue to reference C<schema('slave1')> in your code in both
environments by simply creating a schema alias in your development.yml config
file, as shown above.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 schema

    my $user = schema->resultset('User')->find('bob');

The C<schema> keyword returns a L<DBIx::Class::Schema> object ready for you to
use.
If you have configured only one database, then you can simply call C<schema>
with no arguments.
If you have configured multiple databases,
you can still call C<schema> with no arguments if there is a database
named C<default> in the configuration.
With no argument, the C<default> schema is returned.
Otherwise, you B<must> provide C<schema()> with the name of the database:

    my $user = schema('foo')->resultset('User')->find('bob');

=head2 resultset

This is a convenience method that will save you some typing.
Use this B<only> when accessing the C<default> schema.

    my $user = resultset('User')->find('bob');

is equivalent to:

    my $user = schema->resultset('User')->find('bob');

=head2 rset

    my $user = rset('User')->find('bob');

This is simply an alias for C<resultset>.

=head1 SCHEMA GENERATION

Setting the schema_class option and having proper DBIx::Class classes
is the recommended approach for performance and stability.
You can use the L<dbicdump> command line tool provided by
L<DBIx::Class::Schema::Loader> to help you.
For example, if your app were named Foo, then you could run the following
from the root of your project directory:

    dbicdump -o dump_directory=./lib Foo::Schema dbi:SQLite:/path/to/foo.db

For this example, your C<schema_class> setting would be C<'Foo::Schema'>.
